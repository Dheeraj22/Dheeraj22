I'm Dheeraj Kamath, an Embedded Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience developing firmware for complex embedded systems for Automotive, Industrial and Consumer applications with software stack involving Linux, FreeRTOS, QNX on ARM based platforms.

### Skills

*   **Programming Languages:** C, C++, Python
*   **Architectures:** ARM v7, ARM v8, Intel x86
*   **Operating Systems:** Linux, QNX, FreeRTOS
*   **Build Systems:** Bazel, CMake, Make
*   **Protocols:** I2C, SPI, UART, PTP

### Work Experience

*   **Embedded Software Engineer | Aeva Technologies | Mountain View, CA (Dec 2023 - Present)**
    *   Developed firmware to control the optical components of the lidar system like lasers, photodetectors, optical amplifiers etc.
    *   Developed controls and applications on QNX to configure the lidar system, DSP datapaths and get real-time health and telemetry data of all the embedded components within the lidar system.
    *   Developed device driver for IPC on QNX to facilitate data transfer between the multiple processors in the SoC in the order of a few nanoseconds.
    *   Developed unit tests, Software In Loop (SIL), Hardware in Loop (HIL) tests to write robust error-free code as mandated in ASPICE processes.
*   **Staff Systems Applications Engineer | Infineon Technologies | Lynnwood, WA (Nov 2021 - Dec 2023)**
    *   Drafted technical requirements document to configure ARM TrustZone and Trusted Firmware-M (TFM) by working with Marketing, Design and Software that is projected to save application design time by 50%.
    *   Developed firmware to demonstrate secure boot using RSA/ECC, chain of trust, bootloading, debug port access restrictions and lifecycle management on PSoC6 which quickly became the most widely used code example by customers for securing their chips.
*   **Senior Applications Engineer | Cypress Semiconductors | Bangalore, India (Jun 2018 - Oct 2021)**
    *   Embedded Software lead with 1000+ customer issues resolved on various toolchains, build systems (Make, CMake), IDEs, Windows host and Android Applications, RTOS, Digital Peripherals (DMA, Crypto, SegLCD, PWM, Timers), Communication Protocols and Low-Power Modes on ARM CPUs with a Net Promoter Score of 9/10.

### Projects

*   **Aruco Marker based Robot Localisation** - Developed firmware in Python for Image processing operations like countour and object detection, filtering, drawing, camera calibration, pose estimation and estimated the location of a robot in a localized environment using Aruco Markers and Image Processing on Raspberry Pi.
*   **Home Automation** - Developed NodeMCU firmware to control curtains, lights, fans and projector in the lab using motors, and relays, with user input from a custom android app developed using Android Studio done remotely over WiFi.
*   **Two-wheel balance bot** - Develop the electronics and firmware to balance a two-wheeled bot using control system techniques and sensors to detect angle and acceleration using PSoC6 and FreeRTOS. Developed Android App to communicate with it over Bluetooth.
